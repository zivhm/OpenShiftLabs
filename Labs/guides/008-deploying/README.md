# 008-Deploying — DeploymentConfig vs K8s Deployment, rolling strategies, scaling

This module explains running applications in OpenShift using DeploymentConfig and Kubernetes Deployments, including strategies for rolling upgrades and scaling.

## Objectives

- Understand the differences between DeploymentConfig and Kubernetes Deployments.
- Configure rolling update strategies and perform a controlled rollout.
- Scale applications and set up health checks and readiness/liveness probes.

## Tasks

1. Deploy a sample app and compare the outcomes between a `DeploymentConfig` and a `Deployment`.
2. Perform a rolling update and validate traffic continuity.
3. Scale the application up and down and observe resource usage.

Estimated time: 30–60 minutes
