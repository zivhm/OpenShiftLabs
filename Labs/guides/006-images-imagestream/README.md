# 007-Building Images & ImageStream — Using BuildConfigs, ImageStreams, and registry interactions

This module dives into OpenShift-specific build primitives: BuildConfigs, ImageStreams, and how images move between registries.

## Objectives

- Use BuildConfigs and ImageStreams to manage build artifacts.
- Inspect ImageStreams, tags, and registry contents.
- Learn how to import/export images and configure build triggers.

## Tasks

1. Create a BuildConfig via the web console (Developer → Add → From Git) and observe ImageStream updates.
2. View ImageStreams in the console (Administrator → Builds → ImageStreams).
3. Manage image tags through the web console interface.

Estimated time: 45–60 minutes
