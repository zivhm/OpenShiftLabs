# 004-Docker Lifecycle — Building, tagging, and managing local Docker images

This module covers local image lifecycles including build, tag, push, and local registry usage.

## Objectives

- Build container images using Docker or Buildah.
- Tag and push images to a registry or OpenShift ImageStream.
- Clean up images and learn good naming/tagging practices.

## Tasks

1. Build a sample application image with `docker build` or `buildah bud`.
2. Tag the image and push it to the cluster's internal registry or a public registry.
3. Verify images in ImageStreams or registry.

Estimated time: 30–45 minutes
