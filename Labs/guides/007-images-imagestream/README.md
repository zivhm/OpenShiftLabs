# 007-Building Images & ImageStream — Using BuildConfigs, ImageStreams, and registry interactions

This module dives into OpenShift-specific build primitives: BuildConfigs, ImageStreams, and how images move between registries.

## Objectives

- Use BuildConfigs and ImageStreams to manage build artifacts.
- Inspect ImageStreams, tags, and registry contents.
- Learn how to import/export images and configure build triggers.

## Tasks

1. Create a BuildConfig for a sample source repo and observe its `ImageStream` updates.
2. Create an ImageStream and push an image to it using tags.
3. Demonstrate image import or export operations with `oc import-image` and `oc tag`.

Estimated time: 45–60 minutes
